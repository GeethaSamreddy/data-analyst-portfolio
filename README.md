## Projects

### 1. Superstore Sales Analysis
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Dataset:** US Superstore retail sales data (9,994 records)  

**Business Questions Answered:**
- Which category drives the most sales?
- Which region is most profitable?
- Which sub-categories are losing money?

**Key Finding:** Tables, Bookcases and Supplies are loss-making 
sub-categories despite driving sales volume — a pricing review 
is recommended.
